  <h3 class="revealable">What is Climate Change?</h3>
  <div class="header-container revealable">
    <div class="header-item">
      <p id="text">Climate change is a long-term shift in the average weather patterns that have come to   define Earth's climate. It is caused by human activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to a rise in the Earth's temperature. This can cause a wide range of impacts, such as more frequent and intense weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and wildlife behavior. Addressing climate change requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adapting to the impacts of climate change that are already occurring. Efforts to mitigate climate change involve reducing GHG emissions, transitioning to cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar power, improving energy efficiency, and adopting more sustainable practices in areas such as transportation, agriculture, and urban planning. Additionally, adaptation measures are needed to cope with the impacts of climate change that are already happening and cannot be avoided. These measures include building infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events, protecting ecosystems, and developing early warning systems for natural disasters. There are people who do not believe in climate change or its impacts, despite the overwhelming evidence and consensus among the scientific community. Some of these individuals argue that the Earth's climate is always changing naturally and that human activities have little to no effect on it. Others claim that the data used to support climate change is manipulated or unreliable, or that it is part of a larger conspiracy to promote certain political or economic interests. However, the majority of scientific studies and data indicate that climate change is real and caused by human activities. Many national and international organizations, including the United Nations and national scientific academies, have called for urgent action to address the issue.

  <div class="list-container revealable">
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce energy consumption: Turn off lights and electronics when they are not in use, use energy-efficient appliances, and choose renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.</li>
        <li>Reduce transportation emissions: Use public transportation, carpool, bike, or walk whenever possible. Consider purchasing a hybrid or electric vehicle.</li>
        <li>Advocate for climate policies: Contact elected officials and advocate for policies that address climate change, such as emissions regulations, carbon pricing, and subsidies for renewable energy.</li>
